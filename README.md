# Prework Portfolio
This my very first coding project assigned as prework for my coding bootcamp at University of Oregon. It is a basic HTML website with information about me. It has a short bio and a list of my featured coding projects. It is a single HTML page with CSS and Vanilla JavaScript, deployed on Netlify. It was originally a static HTML site that I have since refactored to pull content from Sanity.io which keeps the content up to date.
